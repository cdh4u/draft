      <t>
        This specification defines a new Session Description
        Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework
        extension, 'BUNDLE'. The extension can be used with the
        SDP Offer/Answer mechanism to negotiate the usage of a
        single address:port combination (BUNDLE address) for receiving media,
        referred to as bundled media, specified by multiple
        SDP media descriptions ("m=" sections).
      </t>
      <t>
        To assist endpoints in negotiating the use of bundle this
        specification defines a new SDP attribute, 'bundle-only',
        which can be used to request that specific media is only
        used if bundled. The specification also updates RFC 3264,
        to allow usage of zero port values without meaning that
        media is rejected.
      </t>
      <t>
        There are multiple ways to correlate the bundled RTP
        packets with the appropriate media descriptions. This
        specification defines a new Real-time Transport Protocol
        (RTP) source description (SDES) item and a new RTP header
        extension that provides an additional way to do this
        correlation by using them to carry a value that
        associates the RTP/RTCP packets with a specific media
        description.

  <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
   <t>
     When multimedia communications are established, each 5-tuple reserved for an individual media stream
     consume additional resources (especially when Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
     <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5245"/> is used). For this reason, it is
     attractive to use a 5-tuple for multiple media streams.
  </t>
  <t>
    This specification defines a way to use a single address:port combination (BUNDLE address) for
    receiving media specified by multiple SDP media descriptions ("m=" sections).
  </t>
  <t>
    This specification defines a new SDP Grouping Framework <xref format="default" pageno="false"
    target="RFC5888"/> extension called 'BUNDLE'. The extension can be used with the Session Description
    Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer mechanism <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3264"/>
    to negotiate the usage of a BUNDLE group. Within a BUNDLE group, a BUNDLE address is used
    for receiving media specified by multiple "m=" sections. This is referred to as bundled media.
  </t>
  <t>
    The offerer and answerer <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3264"/> use
    the BUNDLE extension to negotiate the BUNDLE addresses, one for the offerer (offerer BUNDLE
    address) and one for the answerer (answerer BUNDLE address), to be used for receiving
    the bundled media specified by a BUNDLE group. Once the offerer and the answerer have
    negotiated a BUNDLE group, they assign their respective BUNDLE address to each "m=" section
    in the BUNDLE group. The BUNDLE addresses are used to receive all media specified by
    the BUNDLE group.
  </t>
  <t>
    The use of a BUNDLE group and a BUNDLE address also allows the usage of a single set of
    Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5245"/>
    candidates for multiple "m=" sections.
  </t>
  <t>
    This specification also defines a new SDP attribute, 'bundle-only', which can be used to
    request that specific media is only used if kept within a BUNDLE group. The specification
    also updates RFC 3264, to allow usage of zero port values without meaning that media is rejected.
  </t>
  <t>
    As defined in RFC 4566 <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC4566"/>, the
    semantics of assigning the same transport address (IP address and port) to multiple
    "m=" sections are undefined, and there is no grouping defined by such means. Instead, an
    explicit grouping mechanism needs to be used to express the intended semantics. This
    specification provides such an extension.
  </t>
  <t>
    This specification also updates sections 5.1, 8.1 and 8.2 of RFC 3264 <xref format="default" pageno="false"
    target="RFC3264"/>. The update allows an answerer to assign a non-zero port value to an "m=" section in an
    SDP answer, even if the "m=" section in the associated SDP offer contained a zero port value.
  </t>
  <t>
    This specification also defines a new Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) <xref format="default"
    pageno="false" target="RFC3550"/> source description (SDES) item, 'MID', and a new RTP SDES header
    extension that can be used to associate RTP streams with media descriptions.
  </t>
  <t>
    SDP bodies can contain multiple BUNDLE groups. A given BUNDLE address MUST only be associated
    with a single BUNDLE group. The procedures in this specification apply independently to a given
    BUNDLE group. All RTP based media flows described by a single BUNDLE group belong to a single
    RTP session <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3550"/>.
  </t>
  <t>
    The BUNDLE extension is backward compatible. Endpoints that do not support the extension
    are expected to generate offers and answers without an SDP 'group:BUNDLE' attribute, and
    are expected to assign a unique address to each "m=" section within an offer and answer, according
    to the procedures in <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC4566"/> and
    <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3264"/>
  </t>
  </section>


    <section title="Terminology" toc="default">
    <t>
      "m=" section: SDP bodies contain one or more media descriptions, also referred to
      as "m=" sections. Each "m=" section is represented by an SDP "m=" line, and zero or more
      SDP attributes associated with the "m=" line.
    </t>
    <t>
      5-tuple: A collection of the following values: source address, source
      port, destination address, destination port, and transport-layer
      protocol.
    </t>
    <t>
      Unique address: An IP address and port combination that is assigned to
      only one "m=" section in an offer or answer.
    </t>
    <t>
      Shared address: An IP address and port combination that is assigned to
      multiple "m=" sections within an offer or answer.
    </t>
    <t>
      Offerer BUNDLE-tag: The first identification-tag in a given
      SDP 'group:BUNDLE' attribute identification-tag list in an offer.
    </t>
    <t>
      Answerer BUNDLE-tag: The first identification-tag in a given
      SDP 'group:BUNDLE' attribute identification-tag list in an answer.
    </t>
    <t>
      Offerer BUNDLE address: Within a given BUNDLE group, an IP address and
      port combination used by an offerer to receive all media specified
      by each "m=" section within the BUNDLE group.
    </t>
    <t>
      Answerer BUNDLE address: Within a given BUNDLE group, an IP address and
      port combination used by an answerer to receive all media specified
      by each "m=" section within the BUNDLE group.
    </t>
    <t>
      BUNDLE group: A set of "m=" sections, created using an SDP Offer/Answer
      exchange, which uses the same BUNDLE address for receiving media.
    </t>
    <t>
      Bundled "m=" section: An "m=" section, whose identification-tag
      is placed in an SDP 'group:BUNDLE' attribute identification-tag list
      in an offer or answer.
    </t>
    <t>
      Bundle-only "m=" section: A bundled "m=" section that contains an
      SDP 'bundle-only' attribute.
    </t>
    <t>
      Bundled media: All media specified by a given BUNDLE group.
    </t>
    <t>
      Initial offer: The first offer, within an SDP session (e.g. a SIP dialog
      when the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref format="default"
      pageno="false" target="RFC3261" /> is used to carry SDP), in which
      the offerer indicates that it wants to create a given BUNDLE group.
    </t>
    <t>
      Subsequent offer: An offer which contains a BUNDLE group that
      has been created as part of a previous offer/answer exchange.
    </t>
    <t>
      Identification-tag: A unique token value that is used to identify an
      "m=" section. The SDP 'mid' attribute <xref format="default" pageno="false"
      target="RFC5888" /> in an "m=" section carries the unique identification-tag 
      assigned to that "m=" section. The session-level  SDP 'group' attribute 
      <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5888" /> carries a list of 
      identification-tags, identifying the "m=" sections associated with that
      particular 'group' attribute.

  <section title="SDP Grouping Framework BUNDLE Extension" anchor="sec-group" toc="default">
    <t>
      This section defines a new SDP Grouping Framework extension
      <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5888"/>, 'BUNDLE'. The
      BUNDLE extension can be used with the SDP Offer/Answer mechanism to negotiate
      the usage of a single address:port combination (BUNDLE address) for receiving bundled media.
    </t>
    <t>
      A single address:port combination is also used for sending bundled media. The address:port
      combination used for sending bundled media MAY be the same as the BUNDLE address, used to receive
      bundled media, depending on whether symmetric RTP <xref format="default" pageno="false"
      target="RFC4961"/> is used.
    </t>
    <t>
      All media associated with a BUNDLE group MUST be transport using the same
      transport-layer protocol (e.g., UDP or TCP).
    </t>
    <t>
      The BUNDLE extension is indicated using an SDP 'group' attribute
      with a "BUNDLE" semantics value <xref format="default" pageno="false"
      target="RFC5888"/>. An identification-tag is assigned to each each bundled
      "m=" section, and each identification-tag is listed in the SDP 'group:BUNDLE'
      attribute identification-tag list. Each "m=" section whose identification-tag
      is listed in the identification-tag list is associated with a given
      BUNDLE group.
    </t>
    <t>
      SDP bodies can contain multiple BUNDLE groups. Any given bundled "m="
      section MUST NOT be associated with more than one BUNDLE group.
    </t>
    <t>
      NOTE: The order of the "m=" sections listed in the SDP 'group:BUNDLE' attribute
      identification-tag list does not have to be the same as the order in which
      the "m=" sections occur in the SDP.

    <t>
      This section defines a new SDP media-level attribute <xref target="RFC4566" pageno="false"

    <t>
      In order to ensure that an answerer that does not support the BUNDLE extension always
      rejects a bundled "m=" section, the offerer can assign a zero port value to the "m="
      section. According to <xref target="RFC3264" pageno="false" format="default"/> an answerer
      will reject such "m=" section.
      By including an SDP 'bundle-only' attribute in such "m=" section, the offerer can
      request that the answerer accepts the "m=" section if the answerer supports the Bundle
      extension, and if the answerer keeps the "m=" section within the associated BUNDLE group.
    </t>
    <t>
      NOTE: Once the offerer BUNDLE address has been selected, the offerer does
      not need to include the 'bundle-only' attribute in subsequent offers. By
      assigning the offerer BUNDLE address to an "m=" section of a subsequent offer,
      the offerer will ensure that the answerer will either keep the "m=" section within
      the BUNDLE group, or the answerer will have to reject the "m=" section.
    </t>
    <t>
      The usage of the 'bundle-only' attribute is only defined for a bundled "m=" section with
      a zero port value, within an offer. Other usage is unspecified.

        generates an offer in which the offerer wants to create a BUNDLE group,
        and the answerer rejects the offer, the BUNDLE group is not created.

          IDENTICAL and TRANSPORT mux category SDP attributes <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-mux-attributes" />
          are included in the "m=" section only if the "m=" section is also associated with
          the offerer/answerer BUNDLE-tag. Otherwise the offerer/answerer MUST NOT include

        <t>
          NOTE: As bundled "m=" section (including any bundle-only "m=" section) to which a shared

          For example, the semantics of the SDP 'rtcp-mux' and SDP 'rtcp-mux-only' attributes
          only apply to "m=" sections describing RTP-based media. However, as described in

          mux category SDP attributes are only included in the "m=" sections associated with

          attributes can be included in an "m=" section associated with another type of media.

          <list style="symbols">

            </t>
            <t>
              The answerer MUST NOT include an "m=" section within a BUNDLE group, unless

          If the answerer keeps a bundle-only "m=" section within the BUNDLE group,

          In an offer, the address (unique or shared) assigned to the bundled "m=" section

            <t>
              The answerer will not move the "m=" section out of the BUNDLE group

        <t>
          If all of the criteria above are fulfilled, the answerer MUST select the address
          assigned to the "m=" section as the offerer BUNDLE address. In the answer, the
          answerer BUNDLE-tag represents the "m=" section, and the address assigned to the 
          "m=" section in the offer becomes the offerer BUNDLE address.
        </t>
        <t>
          If one or more of the criteria are not fulfilled, the answerer MUST select the next

          check for the "m=" section associated with that identification-tag. If there are no
          more identification-tags in the identification-tag list, the answerer MUST NOT
          create the BUNDLE group. In addition, unless the answerer rejects the whole offer,
          the answerer MUST apply the answerer procedures for moving an "m=" section out of a

          <t>
            In the corresponding offer, a shared address (e.g. a previously selected offerer BUNDLE address)

        <t>
            NOTE: The text in this section is copied from Appendix B of JSEP. The
            community has not yet agreed on the text.
        </t>
        <t>
            As described in <xref target="RFC3550" />, RTP packets are associated with RTP
            streams <xref target="RFC7656" />. Each RTP stream is identified by an SSRC
            value, and each RTP packet includes an SSRC field that is
            used to associate the packet with the correct RTP stream.
            RTCP packets also use SSRCs to identify which RTP streams the
            packet relates to. However, a RTCP packet can contain multiple SSRC
            fields, in the course of providing feedback or reports on different RTP
            streams, and therefore can be associated with multiple such streams.
        </t>
        <t>
            In order to be able to process received RTP/RTCP packets
            correctly, it must be possible to associate an RTP stream with
            the correct "m=" section, as the "m=" section and SDP attributes
            associated with the "m=" section contains information needed to
            process the packets.
        </t>
        <t>
            As all RTP streams associated with a BUNDLE group use the
            same address:port combination for sending and receiving RTP/RTCP
            packets, the local address:port combination cannot be used to
            associate an RTP stream with the correct "m=" section. In addition,
            multiple RTP streams might be associated with the same "m="
            section.
        </t>
        <t>
            An offerer and answerer can inform each other which SSRC
            values they will use for an RTP stream by using the SDP 'ssrc'
            attribute <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5576"/>.
            However, an offerer will not know which SSRC values the
            answerer will use until the offerer has received the answer
            providing that information. Due to this, before the offerer has
            received the answer, the offerer will not be able to associate
            an RTP stream with the correct "m=" section using the SSRC value
            associated with the RTP stream. In addition, the offerer and
            answerer may start using new SSRC values mid-session, without
            informing each other using the SDP 'ssrc' attribute.
        </t>
        <t>
            In order for an offerer and answerer to always be able to
            associate an RTP stream with the correct "m=" section, the offerer
            and answerer using the BUNDLE extension MUST support the
            mechanism defined in <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="sec-receiver-id"/>, 
            where the offerer and answerer insert the identification-tag associated 
            with an "m=" section (provided by the remote peer) into RTP and RTCP 
            packets associated with a BUNDLE group.
         </t>
         <t>
             When using this mechanism, the mapping from an SSRC to an
             identification-tag is carried in RTP header extensions or RTCP SDES
             packets, as specified in <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="sec-receiver-id"/>. 
             Since a compound RTCP packet can contain multiple RTCP SDES packets, 
             and each RTCP SDES packet can contain multiple chunks, a single RTCP 
             packet can contain several SSRC to identification-tag mappings. The 
             offerer and answerer maintain tables used for routing that are updated 
             each time an RTP/RTCP packet contains new information that affects how 
             packets should be routed.
         </t>
         <t>
             However, some implementations of may not include this identification-tag
             in their RTP and RTCP traffic when using the BUNDLE mechanism,
             and instead use a payload type based mechanism to associate RTP streams with SDP "m=" sections.
             In this situation, each "m=" section MUST use unique payload type values,
             in order for the payload type to be a reliable indicator of the relevant
             "m=" section for the RTP stream.
             Note that when using the payload type to associate RTP streams
             with "m=" sections an RTP stream, identified by SSRC, will be mapped
             to an "m=" section when the first packet of that RTP stream is received,
             and the mapping will not be changed even if the payload type used by
             that RTP stream changes. In other words, the SSRC cannot to "move" to a 
             different "m=" section simply by changing the payload type.
         </t>
         <t>
             Applications can implement RTP stacks in many different
             ways. The algorithm below details one way that RTP streams can be
             associated with "m=" sections, but is not meant to be prescriptive
             about exactly how an RTP stack needs to be implemented.
             Applications MAY use any algorithm that achieves equivalent results to
             those described in the algorithm below.

           If the RTP packet contains one of more contributing source (CSRC)
           identifiers, then each CSRC is looked up in the incoming SSRC table
           and a copy of the RTP packet is associated with the corresponding
           "m=" section for additional processing.
          </t>
          <t>
              For each RTCP packet received (including each RTCP packet that
              is part of a compound RTCP packet), the packet is processed as
              usual by the RTP layer, then is passed to the "m=" sections
              corresponding to the RTP streams it contains information about
              for additional processing.
              This routing is type-dependent, as each kind of RTCP
              packet has its own mechanism for associating it with the relevant
              RTP streams.
          </t>
          <t>
              RTCP packets for which no appropriate "m=" section can be
              identified MUST be processed as usual by the RTP layer,
              updating the metadata associated with the corresponding RTP
              streams, but are not passed to any "m=" section. This situation
              can occur with certain multiparty RTP topologies, or when
              RTCP packets are sent containing a subset of the SDES
              information.
          </t>
          <t>
              Rules for additional processing of the various types of RTCP packets are
              explained below.

              <t>
                If the RTCP packet is of type SDES, for each chunk in the packet
                whose SSRC is found in the incoming SSRC table, deliver a copy
                of the SDES packet to the "m=" section associated with that SSRC.
                In addition, for any SDES MID items contained in these chunks,
                if the MID is found in the table mapping MID to "m=" section,
                update the incoming SSRC table to include an entry that
                maps the RTP stream associated with chunk's SSRC to the "m=" section 
                associated with that MID, unless the packet is older than the packet 
                that most recently updated the mapping for this SSRC, as discussed in
                <xref target="RFC7941"/>, Section 4.2.6.
            </t>
            <t>
                Note that if an SDES packet is received as part of a compound
                RTCP packet, the SSRC to "m=" section mapping may not exist until
                the SDES packet is handled (e.g., in the case where RTCP for a
                source is received before any RTP packets). Therefore, when
                processing a compound packet, any contained SDES packet MUST
                be handled first. Note that this is a backwards change from
                <xref target="RFC3550" /> Section 6.1, which states that
                  "Each individual RTCP packet in the compound packet may be
                  processed independently with no requirements upon the order
                  or combination of packets".

                If the RTCP packet is of type BYE, it indicates that the RTP streams
                referenced in the packet are ending. Therefore, for each SSRC
                indicated in the packet that is found in the incoming SSRC table,
                first deliver a copy of the BYE packet to the "m=" section associated
                with that SSRC, but then remove the entry for that SSRC from the
                incoming SSRC table after an appropriate delay to
                account for "straggler packets", as specified in <xref

                If the RTCP packet is of type SR or RR, for each report block in
                the report whose "SSRC of source" is found in the outgoing
                SSRC table, deliver a copy of the SR or RR packet to the "m=" section
                associated with that SSRC. In addition, if the packet is of type
                SR, and the sender SSRC for the packet is found in the
                incoming SSRC table, deliver a copy of the SR packet to the "m=" section

                for each report block in the report whose "SSRC of source" is
                is found in the outgoing SSRC table, deliver a copy of the
                XR packet to the "m=" section associated with that SSRC.
                In addition, if the sender SSRC for the packet is found in the
                incoming SSRC table, deliver a copy of the XR packet to the "m=" section
                associated with that SSRC.

                as defined in <xref target="RFC4585" />, it will contain a
                media source SSRC, and this SSRC is used for routing certain
                subtypes of feedback messages. However, several subtypes of
                PSFB messages include target SSRC(s) in a section called
                Feedback Control Information (FCI). For these messages,
                the target SSRC(s) are used for routing.

        This section describes how to use the BUNDLE grouping extension together
        with the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) mechanism <xref
        format="default" pageno="false" target="I-D.ietf-ice-rfc5245bis"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The generic procedures for negotiating usage of ICE using SDP, defined
        in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice-sip-sdp"/>, also apply to usage of ICE
        with BUNDLE, with the following exceptions:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            When BUNDLE addresses for a BUNDLE group have been selected for both endpoints, ICE
            connectivity checks and keep-alives only need to be performed for the whole BUNDLE group,
            instead of per bundled "m=" section.
          </t>
          <t>
            Among bundled "m=" sections (including any bundle-only "m=" section) to which the offerer
            has assigned a shared address, the offerer only includes ICE-related media-level
            SDP attributes in the "m=" section associated with the offerer BUNDLE-tag, following
            the procedures in <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="sec-sdp-oa-cat"/>.

          <t>
            Among "m=" sections within a BUNDLE group, to which the answerer has assigned a 
            shared address within, the answerer only includes ICE-related media-level SDP attributes
            in the "m=" section associated with the answerer BUNDLE-tag, following the procedures in

    <section title="SDP Offer/Answer Procedures" anchor="sec-ice-oa" toc="default">
      <t>
        When an offerer assigns a unique address to a bundled "m=" section (excluding
        any bundle-only "m=" section), the offerer MUST include SDP 'candidate' attributes (and
        other applicable ICE-related media-level SDP attributes), containing unique ICE properties
        (candidates etc), in the "m=" section according to the procedures in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice-sip-sdp" />.
      </t>
      <t>
        When an offerer assigns a shared address to a bundled "m=" section, the offerer
        MUST include SDP 'candidate' attributes (and other applicable ICE-related
        media-level SDP attributes) in the "m=" section following the procedures in
        <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="sec-sdp-oa-cat"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        When an answerer assigns a shared address to an "m=" section within a BUNDLE group, the
        answerer MUST include SDP 'candidate' attributes (and other applicable ICE-related

        <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="sec-sdp-oa-cat"/>.
      </t>

        NOTE: As most ICE-related media-level SDP attributes belong to the TRANSPORT mux category
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-mux-attributes" />, the offerer and answerer follow the
        procedures in <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="sec-sdp-oa-cat"/> when
        deciding whether to include an attribute in a bundled "m=" section. However, in the
        case of ICE-related media-level attributes, the rules apply to all attributes (see note below),
        even if they belong to a different mux category.

        One or more media streams within a BUNDLE group might use
        the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol
        <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC6347"/>
        in order to encrypt the data, or to negotiate encryption keys
        if another encryption mechanism is used to encrypt media.
      </t>

        When DTLS is used within a BUNDLE group, the following rules
        apply:
        <list style="symbols">
        <t>
          There can only be one DTLS association

          associated with the BUNDLE group; and
        </t>
        <t>
          Each usage of the DTLS association within the BUNDLE
          group MUST use the same mechanism for determining
          which endpoints (the offerer or answerer) become
          DTLS client and DTLS server; and
        </t>
        <t>
          Each usage of the DTLS association within the Bundle

          whether an offer or answer will trigger the
          establishment of a new DTLS association, or whether
          an existing DTLS association will be used; and
        </t>

          If the DTLS client supports DTLS-SRTP
          <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5764"/>

          in the DTLS ClientHello message
          <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5764"/>,
          The client MUST include the extension even if the usage
          of DTLS-SRTP is not negotiated as part of the
          multimedia session (e.g., SIP session <xref format="default"

      </t>
      <t>
        NOTE: The inclusion of the 'use_srtp' extension during the initial
        DTLS handshake ensures that a DTLS renegotiation will not be required
        in order to include the extension, in case DTLS-SRTP encrypted media
        is added to the BUNDLE group later during the multimedia session.

        For recvonly and sendrecv streams, the port number and address in the
        offer indicate where the offerer would like to receive the media
        stream. For sendonly RTP streams, the address and port number

        the port number one higher than the number indicated.  The IP address

        stream is offered but MUST NOT be used.  This has no useful semantics
        in an initial offer, but is allowed for reasons of completeness,
        since the answer can contain a zero port indicating a rejected stream
        (Section 6). Furthermore, existing streams can be terminated by
        setting the port to zero (Section 8). In general, a port number of

      <t>
        SDP Offerers and Answerers <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3264"/>
        can associate identification-tags with "m=" sections within SDP Offers
        and Answers, using the procedures in <xref format="default" pageno="false"
        target="RFC5888"/>. Each identification-tag uniquely represents an "m=" section.
      </t>
      <t>
        This section defines a new RTCP SDES item <xref format="default" pageno="false"
        target="RFC3550"/>, 'MID', which is used to carry identification-tags within RTCP
        SDES packets. This section also defines a new RTP SDES header extension
        <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC7941"/>, which
        is used to carry the 'MID' RTCP SDES item in RTP packets.
      </t>
      <t>
        The SDES item and RTP SDES header extension make it possible for a receiver to associate
        each RTP stream with with a specific "m=" section, with which the receiver has
        associated an identification-tag, even if those "m=" sections are part of the same RTP session.
        The RTP SDES header extension also ensures that the media recipient gets the identification-tag
        upon receipt of the first decodable media and is able to associate the media with the
        correct application.
      </t>
      <t>
        A media recipient informs the media sender about the identification-tag
        associated with an "m=" section through the use of an 'mid' attribute
        <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5888"/>. The media sender then
        inserts the identification-tag in RTCP and RTP packets sent to the media recipient.
      </t>
      <t>
        NOTE: This text above defines how identification-tags are carried in SDP Offers
        and Answers. The usage of other signalling protocols for carrying identification-tags
        is not prevented, but the usage of such protocols is outside the scope of this document.
      </t>
      <t>
        <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3550"/> defines general procedures
        regarding the RTCP transmission interval. The RTCP MID SDES item SHOULD be sent in
        the first few RTCP packets sent after joining the session, and SHOULD be sent regularly
        thereafter. The exact number of RTCP packets in which this SDES item is sent is
        intentionally not specified here, as it will depend on the expected packet loss
        rate, the RTCP reporting interval, and the allowable overhead.
      </t>
      <t>
        The RTP SDES header extension for carrying the 'MID' RTCP SDES SHOULD be included
        in some RTP packets at the start of the session and whenever the SSRC changes. It might
        also be useful to include the header extension in RTP packets that comprise access points in the media
        (e.g., with video I-frames). The exact number of RTP packets in which this header
        extension is sent is intentionally not specified here, as it will depend on expected
        packet loss rate and loss patterns, the overhead the application can tolerate, and
        the importance of immediate receipt of the identification-tag.
      </t>
      <t>
        For robustness purpose, endpoints need to be prepared for situations where the
        reception of the identification-tag is delayed, and SHOULD NOT terminate sessions
        in such cases, as the identification-tag is likely to arrive soon.

          The payload, containing the identification-tag, of the RTP SDES header extension element
          can be encoded using either the one-byte or two-byte header <xref format="default"
          pageno="false" target="RFC7941"/>. The identification-tag payload is UTF-8
          encoded, as in SDP.
        </t>
        <t>
          The identification-tag is not zero terminated. Note, that the set of header extensions
          included in the packet needs to be padded to the next 32-bit boundary using zero
          bytes <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5285"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          As the identification-tag is included in either an RTCP SDES item or an RTP SDES header
          extension, or both, there should be some consideration about the packet expansion
          caused by the identification-tag. To avoid Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) issues
          for the RTP packets, the header extension's size needs to be taken into account when
          encoding the media.
        </t>
        <t>
          It is recommended that the identification-tag is kept short. Due to the properties of
          the RTP header extension mechanism, when using the one-byte header, a tag that is 1-3 bytes
          will result in a minimal number of 32-bit words used for the RTP SDES header extension,
          in case no other header extensions are included at the same time. Note, do take into
          account that some single characters when UTF-8 encoded will result in multiple octets.
          The identification-tag MUST NOT contain any user information, and applications SHALL
          avoid generating the identification-tag using a pattern that enables application
          identification.

  Reference:     RFCXXXX

  The SDES item does not reveal privacy information about the users.
  It is simply used to associate RTP-based media with the correct SDP
  media description ("m=" section) in the SDP used to negotiate the 
  media.

  The purpose of the extension is for the offerer to be able to
  associate received multiplexed RTP-based media before the offerer
  receives the associated SDP answer.

    <section anchor="sec-security" title="Security Considerations" toc="default">
      <t>The security considerations defined in <xref format="default"
      pageno="false" target="RFC3264"/> and <xref format="default"
      pageno="false" target="RFC5888"/> apply to the BUNDLE extension. Bundle
      does not change which information, e.g., RTP streams, flows over
      the network, with the exception of the usage of the MID SDES item as
      discussed below. Primarily it changes which addresses and ports, and
      thus in which (RTP) sessions that the information is flowing in. This
      affects the security contexts being used and can cause previously
      separated information flows to share the same security context. This has very
      little impact on the performance of the security mechanism of the RTP
      sessions. In cases where one would have applied different security
      policies on the different RTP streams being bundled, or where the
      parties having access to the security contexts would have differed
      between the RTP stream, additional analysis of the implications are
      needed before selecting to apply BUNDLE.</t>

      <t>The identification-tag, independent of transport, RTCP SDES packet or
      RTP header extension, can expose the value to parties beyond the
      signaling chain. Therefore, the identification-tag values MUST be
      generated in a fashion that does not leak user information, e.g.,
      randomly or using a per-bundle group counter, and SHOULD be 3 bytes or
      less, to allow them to efficiently fit into the MID RTP header
      extension. Note that if implementations use different methods for
      generating identification-tags this could enable fingerprinting of the
      implementation making it vulnerable to targeted attacks. The
      identification-tag is exposed on the RTP stream level when included in
      the RTP header extensions, however what it reveals of the RTP media
      stream structure of the endpoint and application was already possible to
      deduce from the RTP streams without the MID SDES header extensions. As
      the identification-tag is also used to route the media stream to the
      right application functionality it is also important that the value
      received is the one intended by the sender, thus integrity and the
      authenticity of the source are important to prevent denial of service on
      the application. Existing SRTP configurations and other security
      mechanisms protecting the whole RTP/RTCP packets will provide the
      necessary protection.</t>

      <t>When the BUNDLE extension is used, the set of configurations of the
	  security mechanism used in all the bundled media descriptions will need to
	  be compatible so that they can simultaneously used in parallel, at least
	  per direction or endpoint. When using SRTP this will be the case, at least
	  for the IETF defined key-management solutions due to their SDP attributes
	  (a=crypto, a=fingerprint, a=mikey) and their classification in <xref
	  target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-mux-attributes"/>.</t>

      <t>The security considerations of <xref target="RFC7941">"RTP Header
	  Extension for the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Source Description Items"
	  </xref> requires that when RTCP is confidentiality protected that any SDES
	  RTP header extension carrying an SDES item, such as the MID RTP header
      extension, is also protected using commensurate strength algorithms.
      However, assuming the above requirements and recommendations are
      followed there are no known significant security risks with leaving the
      MID RTP header extension without confidentiality protection. Thus, the
      requirements in RFC 7941 MAY be ignored for the MID RTP header
      extension. Security mechanisms for RTP/RTCP are discussed in Options for
      Securing RTP Sessions <xref format="default" pageno="false"
      target="RFC7201"/>, for example SRTP <xref format="default"
      pageno="false" target="RFC3711"/> can provide the necessary security
      functions of ensuring the integrity and source authenticity.</t>

    <t>
      The usage of the SDP grouping extension for negotiating bundled media is
      based on a similar alternatives proposed by Harald Alvestrand and Cullen
      Jennings. The BUNDLE extension described in this document is based on
      the different alternative proposals, and text (e.g., SDP examples)
      have been borrowed (and, in some cases, modified) from those alternative
      proposals.
    </t>
    <t>
      The SDP examples are also modified versions from the ones in the Alvestrand
      proposal.

  <section  title="Design Considerations" toc="default">
      <t>
        One of the main issues regarding the BUNDLE grouping extensions has been whether,
        in SDP Offers and SDP Answers, the same port value should be inserted in "m="
        lines associated with a BUNDLE group, as the purpose of the extension is to negotiate
        the usage of a single address:port combination for media specified by the
        "m=" sections. Issues with both approaches, discussed in the Appendix have been
        raised. The outcome was to specify a mechanism which uses SDP Offers with both
        different and identical port values.
      </t>

        RFC 4961 specifies a way of doing symmetric RTP but that is an a later
        invention to RTP and Bob can not assume that Alice supports RFC 4961. This
        means that Alice may be sending RTP from a different port than 10000 or
        10002 - some implementation simply send the RTP from an ephemeral
        port. When Bob's endpoint receives an RTP packet, the only way that Bob
        knows if it should be passed to the video or audio codec is by looking at
        the port it was received on. This lead some SDP implementations to use the
        fact that each "m=" section had a different port number to use that port
        number as an index to find the correct m line in the SDP. As a result, some
        implementations that do support symmetric RTP and ICE still use a SDP data
        structure where SDP with "m=" sections with the same port such as:

        will result in the second "m=" section being considered an SDP error
        because it has the same port as the first line.

    <section  title="Usage of port number value zero" toc="default">
      <t>
        In an SDP Offer or SDP Answer, the media specified by an "m=" section can be
        disabled/rejected by setting the port number value to zero. This is different
        from e.g., using the SDP direction attributes, where RTCP traffic will
        continue even if the SDP "inactive" attribute is indicated for the
        associated "m=" section.
      </t>
      <t>
        If each "m=" section associated with a BUNDLE group would contain different
        port values, and one of those port values would be used for a BUNDLE address
        associated with the BUNDLE group, problems would occur if an endpoint wants to
        disable/reject the "m=" sectcion associated with that port, by setting the port
        value to zero. After that, no "m=" section would contain the port value which
        is used for the BUNDLE address.  In addition, it is unclear what would happen
        to the ICE candidates associated with the "m=" section, as they are also used for
        the BUNDLE address.

    <section  title="B2BUA And Proxy Interoperability" toc="default">
      <t>
        Some back to back user agents may be configured in a mode where if
        the incoming call leg contains an SDP attribute the B2BUA does not
        understand, the B2BUA still generates that SDP attribute in the Offer
        for the outgoing call leg. Consider a B2BUA that did not understand
        the SDP "rtcp" attribute, defined in RFC 3605, yet acted this way.
        Further assume that the B2BUA was configured to tear down any call
        where it did not see any RTCP for 5 minutes. In this case, if the B2BUA
        received an Offer like:

      It would be looking for RTCP on port 49172 but would not see any
      because the RTCP would be on port 53020 and after five minutes, it would
      tear down the call. Similarly, a B2BUA that did not understand BUNDLE yet
      put BUNDLE in it's offer may be looking for media on the wrong port and
      tear down the call. It is worth noting that a B2BUA that generated an
      Offer with capabilities it does not understand is not compliant with the
      specifications.

      <section  title="Traffic Policing" toc="default">
        <t>
          Sometimes intermediaries do not act as B2BUA, in the sense that
          they don't modify SDP bodies, nor do they terminate SIP dialogs.
          Still, however, they may use SDP information (e.g., IP address and
          port) in order to control traffic gating functions, and to set
          traffic policing rules. There might be rules which will trigger
          a session to be terminated in case media is not sent or received
          on the ports retrieved from the SDP. This typically occurs once the
          session is already established and ongoing.

        <t>
          Sometimes intermediaries do not act as B2BUA, in the sense that
          they don't modify SDP bodies, nor do they terminate SIP dialogs.
          Still, however, they may use SDP information (e.g., codecs and
          media types) in order to control bandwidth allocation functions.
          The bandwidth allocation is done per "m=" section, which means that
          it might not be enough if media specified by all "m=" sections
          try to use that bandwidth. That may either simply lead to bad
          user experience, or to termination of the call.

    <section  title="Candidate Gathering" toc="default">
      <t>
        When using ICE, a candidate needs to be gathered for each port. This
        takes approximately 20 ms extra for each extra "m=" section due to the NAT
        pacing requirements. All of this gather can be overlapped with other
        things while for exampe a web-page is loading to minimize the impact. If the client
        only wants to generate TURN or STUN ICE candidates for one of the "m="
        lines and then use trickle ICE <xref target="I-D.ietf-ice-trickle"/>
        to get the non host ICE candidates for the rest of the "m=" sections, it MAY do
        that and will not need any additional gathering time.
      </t>
      <t>
        Some people have suggested a TURN extension to get a bunch of TURN
        allocations at once. This would only provide a single STUN result so in
        cases where the other end did not support BUNDLE, may cause more use of
        the TURN server but would be quick in the cases where both sides
        supported BUNDLE and would fall back to a successful call in the other
        cases.
