      <t>
        This specification defines a new Session Description
        Protocol (SDP) Grouping Framework extension, 'BUNDLE'. 
        The extension can be used with the SDP Offer/Answer mechanism 
        to negotiate the usage of a single transport (5-tuple) for 
        sending and receiving media described by multiple SDP media descriptions 
        ("m=" sections). Such transport is referred to as a BUNDLE transport, 
        and the media is referred to as bundled media. The "m=" sections that
        use the BUNDLE transport form a BUNDLE group.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification updates RFC 3264, to also allow assigning a zero port value
        to a "m=" section in cases where the media described by the "m=" section 
        is not disabled or rejected.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification defines a new RTP Control Protocol
        (RTCP) source description (SDES) item and a new RTP header
        extension that can be used to correlate bundled RTP/RTCP packets 
        with their appropriate "m=" section.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification updates RFC 7941, by adding an exception,
        for the MID RTP header extension, to the requirement regarding protection 
        of an SDES RTP header extension carrying an SDES item for the MID RTP 
        header extension.

    <section title="Background" toc="default">
      <t>
        When the SDP offer/answer mechanism <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3264"/>  
        is used to negotiate the establishment of multimedia communication sessions, if separate 
        transports (5-tuples) are negotiated for each individual media stream, each transport consumes 
        additional resources (especially when Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
        <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="I-D.ietf-ice-rfc5245bis"/> is used). 
        For this reason, it is attractive to use a single transport for multiple media streams.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="BUNDLE Mechanism" toc="default">
      <t>
        This specification defines a way to use a single transport (BUNDLE transport) 
        for sending and receiving media (bundled media) described by multiple SDP media descriptions 
        ("m=" sections). The address:port combination used by an endpoint for sending and receiving 
        bundled media is referred to as the BUNDLE address:port. The set of SDP attributes that are 
        applied to each "m=" section within a BUNDLE group is referred to as BUNDLE attributes. 
        The same BUNDLE transport is used for sending and receiving bundled media, which
        means that the symmetric Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) mechanism <xref format="default" 
       pageno="false" target="RFC4961"/> is always used for RTP-based bundled media.
      </t>
      <t>
        This specification defines a new SDP Grouping Framework <xref format="default" pageno="false"
        target="RFC5888"/> extension called 'BUNDLE'. The extension can be used with the Session Description
        Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer mechanism <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3264"/>
        to negotiate which "m=" sections will become part of a BUNDLE group. In addition, the offerer and 
        answerer <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3264"/> use the BUNDLE extension to negotiate 
        the BUNDLE addresses:ports (offerer BUNDLE address:port and answerer BUNDLE address:port) and the 
        set of BUNDLE attributes (offerer BUNDLE attributes and answerer BUNDLE attributes) that will be applied to
        each "m=" section within the BUNDLE group.
      </t>
      <t>
        The use of a BUNDLE transport allows the usage of a single set of
        Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) <xref format="default" pageno="false" 
        target="I-D.ietf-ice-rfc5245bis"/> candidates for the whole BUNDLE group.
      </t>
      <t>
        A given BUNDLE address:port MUST only be associated with a single BUNDLE group. If an SDP offer 
        or answer contains multiple BUNDLE groups, the procedures in this specification apply to each 
        group independently. All RTP-based bundled media associated with a given BUNDLE group belong to a single
        RTP session <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3550"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The BUNDLE extension is backward compatible. Endpoints that do not support the extension
        are expected to generate offers and answers without an SDP 'group:BUNDLE' attribute, and
        are expected to assign a unique address:port to each "m=" section within an offer and answer, according
        to the procedures in <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC4566"/> and
       <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC3264"/>.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Protocol Extensions" toc="default">
      <t>
        In addition to defining the new SDP Grouping Framework extension, this specification defines
        the following protocol extensions and RFC updates:
        <list style="symbols">
        <t>
          The specification defines a new SDP attribute, 'bundle-only', which can be used to
          request that a specific "m=" section (and the associated media) is used only used if kept 
          within a BUNDLE group.
        </t>
        <t>  
          The specification updates RFC 3264 <xref format="default" pageno="false" 
          target="RFC3264"/>, to also allow assigning a zero port value to a "m=" section 
          in cases where the media described by the "m=" section is not disabled or rejected.
        </t>
        <t>
          The specification defines a new RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) <xref format="default"
          pageno="false" target="RFC3550"/> source description (SDES) item, 'MID', and a new RTP SDES header
          extension that can be used to associate RTP streams with "m=" sections.
        </t>
        <t>
          The specification updates <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC7941"/>, by adding an exception,
          for the MID RTP header extension, to the requirement regarding protection

  <section title="SDP Grouping Framework BUNDLE Extension" anchor="sec-group" toc="default">
    <t>
       This section defines a new SDP Grouping Framework <xref format="default" pageno="false"
       target="RFC5888"/> extension, 'BUNDLE'. The BUNDLE extension can be used with the SDP
       Offer/Answer mechanism to negotiate a set of "m=" sections that will become part of a BUNDLE 
       group. Within a BUNDLE group, each "m=" section uses a BUNDLE transport for sending and 
       receiving bundled media. Each endpoint uses a single address:port combination for sending and
       receiving the bundled media.
    </t>
    <t>
       The BUNDLE extension is indicated using an SDP 'group' attribute with a semantics value 
       <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5888"/> of "BUNDLE".
       An identification-tag is assigned to each bundled
       "m=" section, and each identification-tag is listed in the SDP 'group:BUNDLE'
       attribute identification-tag list. Each "m=" section whose identification-tag
       is listed in the identification-tag list is associated with a given
       BUNDLE group.
    </t>
    <t>
       SDP bodies can contain multiple BUNDLE groups. Any given bundled "m="
       section MUST NOT be associated with more than one BUNDLE group at any given
       time.
    </t>
    <t>
       NOTE: The order of the "m=" sections listed in the SDP 'group:BUNDLE' attribute
       identification-tag list does not have to be the same as the order in which
       the "m=" sections occur in the SDP.

    <t>
      This section defines a new SDP media-level attribute <xref target="RFC4566" pageno="false"

      <xref target="RFC4566" pageno="false" format="default"/>, and hence has no value.
    </t>
    <t>
      In order to ensure that an answerer that does not support the BUNDLE extension always
      rejects a bundled "m=" section in an offer, the offerer can assign a zero port value to the "m="
      section. According to <xref target="RFC3264" pageno="false" format="default"/> an answerer
      will reject such an "m=" section.
      By including an SDP 'bundle-only' attribute in a bundled "m=" section, the offerer can
      request that the answerer accepts the "m=" section only if the answerer supports the BUNDLE
      extension, and if the answerer keeps the "m=" section within the associated BUNDLE group.

            An offerer and answerer MUST include SDP attributes in every bundled "m=" section where applicable,

            <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              In the initial BUNDLE offer, the offerer MUST NOT include IDENTICAL and TRANSPORT multiplexing category SDP 
              attributes (BUNDLE attributes) in bundle-only "m=" sections. The offerer MUST include
              such attributes in all other bundled "m=" sections. In the initial BUNDLE offer each bundled "m=" line can contain 
              a different set of BUNDLE attributes, and attribute values. Once the offerer tagged "m=" section has been
              selected, the BUNDLE attributes contained in the offerer tagged "m=" section will apply to each bundled "m=" 
              section within the BUNDLE group.

            <t>
              In a subsequent offer, or in an answer (initial of subsequent), the offerer and answerer MUST include 
              IDENTICAL and TRANSPORT multiplexing category SDP attributes (BUNDLE attributes) only in the tagged "m=" section 
              (offerer tagged "m=" section or answerer tagged "m=" section). The offerer and answerer MUST NOT 
              include such attributes in any other bundled "m=" section. The BUNDLE attributes contained in the tagged "m=" section 
              will apply to each bundled "m=" section within the BUNDLE group.

            <t>
              In an offer (initial BUNDLE offer or subsequent), or in an answer (initial BUNDLE answer or subsequent), the offerer and answerer MUST
              include SDP attributes of other categories than IDENTICAL and TRANSPORT in each bundled "m=" section that
              a given attribute applies to. Each bundled "m=" line can contain a different set of such attributes, and
              attribute values, as such attributes only apply to the given bundled "m=" section in which they are included.

            category SDP attributes which are applicable only to some of the bundled "m=" sections within 
            the BUNDLE group might appear in the tagged "m=" section for which they are not applicable. For instance, 
            the tagged "m=" section might contain an SDP 'rtcp-mux' attribute even if the tagged "m=" section does not describe 
            RTP-based media (but another bundled "m=" section within the BUNDLE group does describe RTP-based media).

          The procedures in this section apply to the first offer, within an SDP session (e.g. a SIP
          dialog when the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] is used to carry SDP), in which the 
          offerer indicates that it wants to negotiate a given BUNDLE group. This could occur in the 
          initial offer, or in a subsequent offer, of the SDP session.
        </t>
        <t>
          When an offerer generates an initial BUNDLE offer, in order to negotiate a
          BUNDLE group, it MUST:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>

              Place the identification-tag of each bundled "m=" section in the

          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
          NOTE: When the offerer assigns unique addresses:ports to multiple bundled "m=" sections, the offerer needs to be prepared
          to receive bundled media on each unique address:port, until it receives the associated answer and finds out which
          bundled "m=" section (and associated address:port combination) the answerer has selected as the offerer tagged "m=" section.
        </t>
        <t>
          If the offerer wants to request that the answerer accepts a given bundled "m=" section only if

          NOTE: If the offerer assigns a zero port value to a bundled "m=" section, but does not include an

          It is RECOMMENDED that the suggested offerer tagged "m=" section is a bundled "m=" section

            As described in <xref target="RFC3550" />, RTP packets are associated with RTP

            value, and each RTP packet includes an SSRC field that is
            used to associate the packet with the correct RTP stream.
            RTCP packets also use SSRCs to identify which RTP streams the
            packet relates to. However, a RTCP packet can contain multiple SSRC
            fields, in the course of providing feedback or reports on different RTP
            streams, and therefore can be associated with multiple such streams.

            process the packets.

            As all RTP streams associated with a BUNDLE group use the
            same transport for sending and receiving RTP/RTCP

            However, an offerer will not know which SSRC values the
            answerer will use until the offerer has received the answer
            providing that information. Due to this, before the offerer has
            received the answer, the offerer will not be able to associate
            an RTP stream with the correct "m=" section using the SSRC value
            associated with the RTP stream. In addition, the offerer and
            answerer may start using new SSRC values mid-session, without
            informing each other using the SDP 'ssrc' attribute.
        </t>
        <t>
            In order for an offerer and answerer to always be able to
            associate an RTP stream with the correct "m=" section, the offerer
            and answerer using the BUNDLE extension MUST support the
            mechanism defined in <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="sec-receiver-id"/>, 
            where the offerer and answerer insert the identification-tag associated 
            with an "m=" section (provided by the remote peer) into RTP and RTCP 
            packets associated with a BUNDLE group.
         </t>
         <t>
             When using this mechanism, the mapping from an SSRC to an
             identification-tag is carried in RTP header extensions or RTCP SDES
             packets, as specified in <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="sec-receiver-id"/>. 
             Since a compound RTCP packet can contain multiple RTCP SDES packets, 
             and each RTCP SDES packet can contain multiple chunks, a single RTCP 
             packet can contain several SSRC to identification-tag mappings. The 
             offerer and answerer maintain tables used for routing that are updated 
             each time an RTP/RTCP packet contains new information that affects how 
             packets are to be routed.
         </t>
         <t>
            However, some legacy implementations may not include this identification-tag
            in their RTP and RTCP traffic when using the BUNDLE mechanism, and
            instead use a payload type based mechanism to associate RTP streams
            with SDP "m=" sections.  In this situation, each "m=" section needs to
            use unique payload type values, in order for the payload type to be a
            reliable indicator of the relevant "m=" section for the RTP stream. If an
            implementation fails to ensure unique payload type values it will be 
            impossible to associate the RTP stream using that payload type value
            to a particular "m=" section. 
            Note that when using the payload type to associate RTP streams with
            "m=" sections an RTP stream, identified by its SSRC, will be mapped
            to an "m=" section when the first packet of that RTP stream is
            received, and the mapping will not be changed even if the payload
            type used by that RTP stream changes.  In other words, the SSRC
            cannot "move" to a different "m=" section simply by changing the
            payload type.
         </t>
         <t>
             Applications can implement RTP stacks in many different
             ways. The algorithm below details one way that RTP streams can be
             associated with "m=" sections, but is not meant to be prescriptive
             about exactly how an RTP stack needs to be implemented.
             Applications MAY use any algorithm that achieves equivalent results to
             those described in the algorithm below.
         </t>
         <t>
             To prepare to associate RTP streams with the correct
             "m=" section, the following steps MUST be followed for each BUNDLE group:
         </t>
         <t><list>
             <t>
                 Construct a table mapping MID to "m=" section for each "m="
                 section in this BUNDLE group. Note that an "m=" section may only
                 have one MID.
             </t>
             <t>
                 Construct a table mapping SSRCs of incoming RTP streams to "m=" section for
                 each "m=" section in this BUNDLE group and for each SSRC
                 configured for receiving in that "m=" section.
             </t>
             <t>
                 Construct a table mapping the SSRC of each outgoing RTP stream 
                 to "m=" section for each "m=" section in this BUNDLE group and for each SSRC
                 configured for sending in that "m=" section.
             </t>
             <t>
                 Construct a table mapping payload type to "m=" section for
                 each "m=" section in the BUNDLE group and for each payload type
                 configured for receiving in that "m=" section. If any payload
                 type is configured for receiving in more than one "m=" section
                 in the BUNDLE group, do not include it in the table, as it
                 cannot be used to uniquely identify an "m=" section.
             </t>
             <t>
                 Note that for each of these tables, there can only be one
                 mapping for any given key (MID, SSRC, or PT). In other
                 words, the tables are not multimaps.
             </t>
         </list></t>
         <t>
             As "m=" sections are added or removed from the BUNDLE groups, or
             their configurations are changed, the tables above MUST also be
             updated.
         </t>
         <t>
             When an RTP packet is received, it MUST be delivered to the RTP
             stream corresponding to its SSRC. That RTP stream MUST then be
             associated with the correct "m=" section within a BUNDLE group, for
             additional processing, according to the following steps:
         </t>
         <t><list>
             <t>
                 If the MID associated with the RTP stream is not in the
                 table mapping MID to "m=" section, then the RTP stream is not
                 decoded and the payload data is discarded.
             </t>
             <t>
                 If the packet has a MID, and the packet's extended sequence number
                 is greater than that of the last MID update, as discussed in
                 <xref target="RFC7941" />, Section 4.2.6, update the MID associated
                 with the RTP stream to match the MID carried in the RTP packet, then
                 update the mapping tables to include an entry that maps the SSRC of
                 that RTP stream to the "m=" section for that MID.
             </t>
             <t>
                 If the SSRC of the RTP stream is in the incoming SSRC
                 mapping table, check that the payload type used by the RTP
                 stream matches a payload type included on the matching
                 "m=" section. If so, associate the RTP stream with that
                 "m=" section. Otherwise, the RTP stream is not decoded and the
                 payload data is discarded.
             </t>
             <t>
                 If the payload type used by the RTP stream is in the
                 payload type table, update the incoming SSRC mapping table
                 to include an entry that maps the RTP stream's SSRC to the
                 "m=" section for that payload type. Associate the RTP stream
                 with the corresponding "m=" section.
             </t>
             <t>
                 Otherwise, mark the RTP stream as not for decoding and
                 discard the payload.
             </t>
           </list>
           If the RTP packet contains one or more contributing source (CSRC)
           identifiers, then each CSRC is looked up in the incoming SSRC table
           and a copy of the RTP packet is associated with the corresponding
           "m=" section for additional processing.
          </t>
          <t>
              For each RTCP packet received (including each RTCP packet that is
              part of a compound RTCP packet), the packet is processed as usual by
              the RTP layer, then associated with the appropriate "m=" sections, and
              processed for the RTP streams represented by those "m=" sections.
              This routing is type-dependent, as each kind of RTCP packet has its own 
              mechanism for associating it with the relevant RTP streams.
          </t>
          <t>
              RTCP packets that cannot be associated with an appropriate "m=" section
              MUST still be processed as usual by the RTP layer, updating the metadata
              associated with the corresponding RTP streams. This situation can occur with 
              certain multiparty RTP topologies, or when RTCP packets are sent containing 
              a subset of the SDES information.
          </t>
          <t>
              Additional rules for processing various types of RTCP packets are
              explained below.
          </t>
          <t><list>
              <t>
                If the RTCP packet is of type SDES, for each chunk in the packet
                whose SSRC is found in the incoming SSRC table, deliver a copy
                of the SDES packet to the "m=" section associated with that SSRC.
                In addition, for any SDES MID items contained in these chunks,
                if the MID is found in the table mapping MID to "m=" section,
                update the incoming SSRC table to include an entry that
                maps the RTP stream associated with the chunk's SSRC to the "m=" section 
                associated with that MID, unless the packet is older than the packet 
                that most recently updated the mapping for this SSRC, as discussed in
                <xref target="RFC7941"/>, Section 4.2.6.
            </t>
            <t>
                Note that if an SDES packet is received as part of a compound RTCP
                packet, the SSRC to "m=" section mapping might not exist until the
                SDES packet is handled (e.g., in the case where RTCP for a source
                is received before any RTP packets). Therefore, it can be beneficial 
                for an implementation to delay RTCP packet routing, such that it 
                either prioritizes processing of the SDES item to generate or update 
                the mapping, or buffers the RTCP information that needs to be 
                routed until the SDES item(s) has been processed. If the 
                implementation is unable to follow this recommendation, the 
                consequence could be that some RTCP information from this 
                particular RTCP compound packet is not provided to higher layers.
                The impact from this is likely minor, when this information relates 
                to a future incoming RTP stream.
            </t>
            <t>
                If the RTCP packet is of type BYE, it indicates that the RTP streams
                referenced in the packet are ending. Therefore, for each SSRC
                indicated in the packet that is found in the incoming SSRC table,
                first deliver a copy of the BYE packet to the "m=" section associated
                with that SSRC, then remove the entry for that SSRC from the
                incoming SSRC table after an appropriate delay to
                account for "straggler packets", as specified in <xref
                target="RFC3550" />, Section 6.2.1.
            </t>
            <t>
                If the RTCP packet is of type SR or RR, for each report block in
                the report whose "SSRC of source" is found in the outgoing
                SSRC table, deliver a copy of the SR or RR packet to the "m=" section
                associated with that SSRC. In addition, if the packet is of type
                SR, and the sender SSRC for the packet is found in the
                incoming SSRC table, deliver a copy of the SR packet to the "m=" section
                associated with that SSRC.
            </t>
            <t>
                If the implementation supports RTCP XR and the packet is of
                type XR, as defined in <xref target="RFC3611" />,
                for each report block in the report whose "SSRC of source"
                is found in the outgoing SSRC table, deliver a copy of the
                XR packet to the "m=" section associated with that SSRC.
                In addition, if the sender SSRC for the packet is found in the
                incoming SSRC table, deliver a copy of the XR packet to the "m=" section
                associated with that SSRC.
            </t>
            <t>
                If the RTCP packet is a feedback message of type RTPFB or PSFB,
                as defined in <xref target="RFC4585" />, it will contain a
                media source SSRC, and this SSRC is used for routing certain
                subtypes of feedback messages. However, several subtypes of
                PSFB and RTPFB messages include target SSRC(s) in a section called
                Feedback Control Information (FCI). For these messages,
                the target SSRC(s) are used for routing.
            </t>
            <t>
                If the RTCP packet is a feedback packet that does not include
                target SSRCs in its FCI section, and the media source SSRC is
                found in the outgoing SSRC table, deliver the
                feedback packet to the "m=" section associated with that SSRC.

            When an offerer generates an initial BUNDLE offer, if the offer contains
            one or more bundled "m=" sections for RTP-based  media (or, if there is a chance that "m=" sections

        This section describes how to use the BUNDLE grouping extension together

        format="default" pageno="false" target="I-D.ietf-ice-rfc5245bis"/>.
      </t>
      <t>
        The generic procedures for negotiating usage of ICE using SDP, defined
        in <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice-sip-sdp"/>, also apply to usage of ICE
        with BUNDLE, with the following exceptions:
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            When the BUNDLE transport has been established, ICE connectivity checks and keep-alives 
            only need to be performed for the BUNDLE transport, instead of per individual bundled "m=" section 
            within the BUNDLE group.
          </t>
          <t>
            The generic SDP attribute offer/answer considerations [<xref format="default" pageno="false" target="sec-sdp-oa-cat"/>] also apply to ICE-related 
            attributes. Therefore, when an offer sends an initial BUNDLE offer (in order to negotiate a BUNDLE group) the offerer
            include ICE-related media-level attributes in each bundled "m=" section (excluding any bundle-only "m=" section),
            and each "m=" section MUST contain unique ICE properties. When an answerer generates an answer (initial BUNDLE answer or subsequent) 
            that contains a BUNDLE group, and when an offerer sends a subsequent offer that contains a BUNDLE group, ICE-related media-level 
            attributes are only included in the tagged "m=" section (suggested offerer tagged "m=" section or answerer tagged "m=" section), and
            the ICE properties are applied to each bundled "m=" section within the BUNDLE group.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
        NOTE: Most ICE-related media-level SDP attributes belong to the TRANSPORT multiplexing category
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-mux-attributes" />, and the generic SDP attribute offer/answer
        considerations for TRANSPORT multiplexing category apply to the attributes. However, in the case of
        ICE-related attributes, the same considerations also apply to ICE-related media-level attributes that
        belong to other multiplexing categories.
      </t>
      <t>
        NOTE: The following ICE-related media-level SDP attributes are defined in
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice-sip-sdp" />: 'candidate', 'remote-candidates', 'ice-mismatch',
        'ice-ufrag', 'ice-pwd', and 'ice-pacing'.
      </t>
      <t>
        Initially, before ICE has produced selected candidate pairs that will be used for media, there might
        be multiple transports established (if multiple candidate pairs are tested). Once ICE has selected
        candidate pairs, they form the BUNDLE transport.
      </t>
      <t>
        Support and usage of ICE mechanism together with the BUNDLE extension
        is OPTIONAL, and the procedures in this section only apply when the
        ICE mechanism is used. Note that applications might mandate usage
        of the ICE mechanism even if the BUNDLE extension is not used.
      </t>
      <t>
        NOTE: If the trickle ICE mechanism <xref target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice-sip" />
        is used, an offerer and answerer might assign a port value of '9', and an IPv4 
        address of '0.0.0.0' (or, the IPv6 equivalent '::') to multiple bundled "m=" sections
        in the initial BUNDLE offer. The offerer and answerer will follow the normal procedures
        for generating the offers and answers, including picking a bundled "m=" section as the
        suggested offerer tagged "m=" section, selecting the tagged "m=" sections etc. The only
        difference is that media can not be sent until one or more candidates have been provided.
        Once a BUNDLE group has been negotiated, trickled candidates associated with a bundled
        "m=" section will be applied to all bundled "m=" sections within the BUNDLE group.

          Each usage of the DTLS association within the BUNDLE
          group MUST use the same mechanism for determining

          establishment of a new DTLS association, or whether
          an existing DTLS association will be used; and

          in the DTLS ClientHello message
          <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5764"/>.
          The client MUST include the extension even if the usage
          of DTLS-SRTP is not negotiated as part of the
          multimedia session (e.g., SIP session <xref format="default"

      </t>
      <t>
        NOTE: The inclusion of the 'use_srtp' extension during the initial
        DTLS handshake ensures that a DTLS renegotiation will not be required
        in order to include the extension, in case DTLS-SRTP encrypted media
        is added to the BUNDLE group later during the multimedia session.

        and Answers, using the procedures in <xref format="default" pageno="false"
        target="RFC5888"/>. Each identification-tag uniquely represents an "m=" section.

      <t>
        This section defines a new RTCP SDES item <xref format="default" pageno="false"
        target="RFC3550"/>, 'MID', which is used to carry identification-tags within RTCP
        SDES packets. This section also defines a new RTP SDES header extension

        is used to carry the 'MID' RTCP SDES item in RTP packets.
      </t>
      <t>
        The SDES item and RTP SDES header extension make it possible for a receiver to associate
        each RTP stream with a specific "m=" section, with which the receiver has
        associated an identification-tag, even if those "m=" sections are part of the same RTP session.
        The RTP SDES header extension also ensures that the media recipient gets the identification-tag
        upon receipt of the first decodable media and is able to associate the media with the
        correct application.
      </t>
      <t>
        A media recipient informs the media sender about the identification-tag
        associated with an "m=" section through the use of an 'mid' attribute
        <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5888"/>. The media sender then
        inserts the identification-tag in RTCP and RTP packets sent to the media recipient.

        NOTE: This text above defines how identification-tags are carried in SDP Offers
        and Answers. The usage of other signaling protocols for carrying identification-tags

        the first few RTCP packets sent after joining the session, and SHOULD be sent regularly
        thereafter. The exact number of RTCP packets in which this SDES item is sent is
        intentionally not specified here, as it will depend on the expected packet loss
        rate, the RTCP reporting interval, and the allowable overhead.
      </t>
      <t>
        The RTP SDES header extension for carrying the 'MID' RTCP SDES SHOULD be included
        in some RTP packets at the start of the session and whenever the SSRC changes. It might
        also be useful to include the header extension in RTP packets that comprise access points in the media
        (e.g., with video I-frames). The exact number of RTP packets in which this header
        extension is sent is intentionally not specified here, as it will depend on expected
        packet loss rate and loss patterns, the overhead the application can tolerate, and
        the importance of immediate receipt of the identification-tag.
      </t>
      <t>
        For robustness, endpoints need to be prepared for situations where the
        reception of the identification-tag is delayed, and SHOULD NOT terminate sessions
        in such cases, as the identification-tag is likely to arrive soon.

          The payload, containing the identification-tag, of the RTP SDES header extension element
          can be encoded using either the one-byte or two-byte header <xref format="default"
          pageno="false" target="RFC7941"/>. The identification-tag payload is UTF-8
          encoded, as in SDP.
        </t>
        <t>
          The identification-tag is not zero terminated. Note, that the set of header extensions
          included in the packet needs to be padded to the next 32-bit boundary using zero
          bytes <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC8285"/>.
        </t>
        <t>
          As the identification-tag is included in either an RTCP SDES item or an RTP SDES header
          extension, or both, there needs to be some consideration about the packet expansion
          caused by the identification-tag. To avoid Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) issues
          for the RTP packets, the header extension's size needs to be taken into account when
          encoding the media.
        </t>
        <t>
          It is recommended that the identification-tag is kept short. Due to the properties of
          the RTP header extension mechanism, when using the one-byte header, a tag that is 1-3 bytes
          will result in a minimal number of 32-bit words used for the RTP SDES header extension,
          in case no other header extensions are included at the same time. Note, do take into
          account that some single characters when UTF-8 encoded will result in multiple octets.
          The identification-tag MUST NOT contain any user information, and applications SHALL avoid 
          generating the identification-tag using a pattern that enables user- or application 
          identification.

      <t>The security considerations defined in <xref format="default"
      pageno="false" target="RFC3264"/> and <xref format="default"
      pageno="false" target="RFC5888"/> apply to the BUNDLE extension. Bundle
      does not change which information, e.g., RTP streams, flows over
      the network, with the exception of the usage of the MID SDES item as
      discussed below. Primarily it changes which addresses and ports, and
      thus in which (RTP) sessions the information is flowing. This
      affects the security contexts being used and can cause previously
      separated information flows to share the same security context. This has very
      little impact on the performance of the security mechanism of the RTP
      sessions. In cases where one would have applied different security
      policies on the different RTP streams being bundled, or where the
      parties having access to the security contexts would have differed
      between the RTP streams, additional analysis of the implications are
      needed before selecting to apply BUNDLE.</t>

      <t>The identification-tag, independent of transport, RTCP SDES packet or
      RTP header extension, can expose the value to parties beyond the
      signaling chain. Therefore, the identification-tag values MUST be
      generated in a fashion that does not leak user information, e.g.,
      randomly or using a per-bundle group counter, and SHOULD be 3 bytes or
      less, to allow them to efficiently fit into the MID RTP header
      extension. Note that if implementations use different methods for
      generating identification-tags this could enable fingerprinting of the
      implementation making it vulnerable to targeted attacks. The
      identification-tag is exposed on the RTP stream level when included in
      the RTP header extensions, however what it reveals of the RTP media
      stream structure of the endpoint and application was already possible to
      deduce from the RTP streams without the MID SDES header extensions. As
      the identification-tag is also used to route the media stream to the
      right application functionality it is important that the value
      received is the one intended by the sender, thus integrity and the
      authenticity of the source are important to prevent denial of service on
      the application. Existing SRTP configurations and other security
      mechanisms protecting the whole RTP/RTCP packets will provide the
      necessary protection.</t>

      <t>When the BUNDLE extension is used, the set of configurations of the
	  security mechanism used in all the bundled media descriptions will need to
	  be compatible so that they can be used simultaneously, at least
	  per direction or endpoint. When using SRTP this will be the case, at least
	  for the IETF defined key-management solutions due to their SDP attributes
	  (a=crypto, a=fingerprint, a=mikey) and their classification in <xref
	  target="I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-mux-attributes"/>.</t>

      <t>The security considerations of "RTP Header
	  Extension for the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Source Description Items"
	  <xref target="RFC7941"/> requires that when RTCP is confidentiality protected, then any SDES
	  RTP header extension carrying an SDES item, such as the MID RTP header
      extension, is also protected using commensurate strength algorithms.
      However, assuming the above requirements and recommendations are
      followed, there are no known significant security risks with leaving the
      MID RTP header extension without confidentiality protection. 
      Therefore, this specification updates RFC 7941 by adding the exception that this requirement 
      MAY be ignored for the MID RTP header extension. Security mechanisms for RTP/RTCP are 
      discussed in Options for Securing RTP Sessions <xref target="RFC7201"/>, 
      for example SRTP <xref target="RFC3711"/> can provide the necessary security 
      functions of ensuring the integrity and source authenticity.

    <t>
      The usage of the SDP grouping extension for negotiating bundled media is
      based on similar alternatives proposed by Harald Alvestrand and Cullen
      Jennings. The BUNDLE extension described in this document is based on
      the different alternative proposals, and text (e.g., SDP examples)
      have been borrowed (and, in some cases, modified) from those alternative
      proposals.
    </t>
    <t>
      The SDP examples are also modified versions from the ones in the Alvestrand
      proposal.

  <section  title="Design Considerations" toc="default">
      <t>
        One of the main issues regarding the BUNDLE grouping extensions has been whether,
        in SDP Offers and SDP Answers, the same port value can be inserted in "m="
        lines associated with a BUNDLE group, as the purpose of the extension is to negotiate
        the usage of a single transport for media specified by the "m=" sections. Issues 
        with both approaches, discussed in the Appendix have been raised. The outcome was to 
        specify a mechanism which uses SDP Offers with both different and identical port values.
      </t>
      <t>
        Below are the primary issues that have been considered when defining the "BUNDLE"
        grouping extension:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>1) Interoperability with existing UAs.</t>
          <t>2) Interoperability with intermediary Back to Back User Agent (B2BUA) and proxy entities.</t>
          <t>3) Time to gather, and the number of, ICE candidates.</t>
          <t>4) Different error scenarios, and when they occur.</t>
          <t>5) SDP Offer/Answer impacts, including usage of port number value zero.</t>

        Consider the following SDP Offer/Answer exchange, where Alice sends an SDP Offer to Bob:

      <t>
        RFC 4961 specifies a way of doing symmetric RTP but that is a later
        extension to RTP and Bob can not assume that Alice supports RFC 4961. This
        means that Alice may be sending RTP from a different port than 10000 or
        10002 - some implementations simply send the RTP from an ephemeral
        port. When Bob's endpoint receives an RTP packet, the only way that Bob
        knows if the packet is to be passed to the video or audio codec is by looking at
        the port it was received on. This led some SDP implementations to use the
        fact that each "m=" section had a different port number to use that port
        number as an index to find the correct m line in the SDP. As a result, some
        implementations that do support symmetric RTP and ICE still use an SDP data
        structure where SDP with "m=" sections with the same port such as:

        because it has the same port as the first line.

    <section  title="Usage of Port Number Value Zero" toc="default">
      <t>
        In an SDP Offer or SDP Answer, the media specified by an "m=" section can be
        disabled/rejected by setting the port number value to zero. This is different
        from e.g., using the SDP direction attributes, where RTCP traffic will
        continue even if the SDP "inactive" attribute is indicated for the
        associated "m=" section.
      </t>
      <t>
        If each "m=" section associated with a BUNDLE group would contain different
        port values, and one of those port values would be used for a BUNDLE address:port
        associated with the BUNDLE group, problems would occur if an endpoint wants to
        disable/reject the "m=" section associated with that port, by setting the port
        value to zero. After that, no "m=" section would contain the port value which
        is used for the BUNDLE address:port. In addition, it is unclear what would happen
        to the ICE candidates associated with the "m=" section, as they are also used for
        the BUNDLE address:port.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section  title="B2BUA And Proxy Interoperability" toc="default">
      <t>
        Some back to back user agents may be configured in a mode where if
        the incoming call leg contains an SDP attribute the B2BUA does not
        understand, the B2BUA still generates that SDP attribute in the Offer
        for the outgoing call leg. Consider a B2BUA that did not understand
        the SDP "rtcp" attribute, defined in RFC 3605, yet acted this way.
        Further assume that the B2BUA was configured to tear down any call
        where it did not see any RTCP for 5 minutes. In this case, if the B2BUA
        received an Offer like:

      It would be looking for RTCP on port 49171 but would not see any
      because the RTCP would be on port 53020 and after five minutes, it would
      tear down the call. Similarly, a B2BUA that did not understand BUNDLE yet
      put BUNDLE in its offer may be looking for media on the wrong port and
      tear down the call. It is worth noting that a B2BUA that generated an
      Offer with capabilities it does not understand is not compliant with the
      specifications.

      <section  title="Traffic Policing" toc="default">
        <t>
          Sometimes intermediaries do not act as B2BUAs, in the sense that
          they don't modify SDP bodies, nor do they terminate SIP dialogs.
          Still, however, they may use SDP information (e.g., IP address and
          port) in order to control traffic gating functions, and to set
          traffic policing rules. There might be rules which will trigger
          a session to be terminated in case media is not sent or received
          on the ports retrieved from the SDP. This typically occurs once the
          session is already established and ongoing.

        <t>
          Sometimes intermediaries do not act as B2BUAs, in the sense that
          they don't modify SDP bodies, nor do they terminate SIP dialogs.
          Still, however, they may use SDP information (e.g., codecs and
          media types) in order to control bandwidth allocation functions.
          The bandwidth allocation is done per "m=" section, which means that
          it might not be enough if media specified by all "m=" sections
          try to use that bandwidth. That may either simply lead to bad
          user experience, or to termination of the call.

    <section  title="Candidate Gathering" toc="default">
      <t>
        When using ICE, a candidate needs to be gathered for each port. This
        takes approximately 20 ms extra for each extra "m=" section due to the NAT
        pacing requirements. All of this gathering can be overlapped with other
        things while e.g., a web-page is loading to minimize the impact. If the client
        only wants to generate TURN or STUN ICE candidates for one of the "m="
        lines and then use trickle ICE <xref target="I-D.ietf-ice-trickle"/>
        to get the non host ICE candidates for the rest of the "m=" sections, it MAY do
        that and will not need any additional gathering time.
      </t>
      <t>
        Some people have suggested a TURN extension to get a bunch of TURN
        allocations at once. This would only provide a single STUN result so in
        cases where the other end did not support BUNDLE, it may cause more use of
        the TURN server but would be quick in the cases where both sides
        supported BUNDLE and would fall back to a successful call in the other
        cases.
